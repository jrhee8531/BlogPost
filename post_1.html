     <h3>AI BUILD TO SCALE:Leaders are maximizing the return on enterprise AI investments</h3>   
     

      
    RESEARCH REPORT
    Scaling to new heights of competitiveness
    84% of C-suite executives believe they must leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve their growth objectives, 
    yet 76% report they struggle with how to scale.
    Three out of four C-suite executives believe that if they donâ€™t scale artificial intelligence (AI) 
    in the next five years, they risk going out of business entirely.
    Companies in our study that are strategically scaling AI report nearly 3X the return from AI 
    investments compared to companies pursuing siloed proof of concepts.
    Further analysis validated a positive correlation between Strategic Scaling and a premium of 32%, on average,
    for three key financial valuation metrics.
